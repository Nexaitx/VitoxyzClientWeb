            <p>
              We noticed a problem: Families were overpaying for care while chasing middlemen and homecare
              nurses did not have a clear understanding of the terms they were agreeing to, nor did they
              have stable demand.

            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, we created Vitoxyz: a transparent platform to help nurses deliver the highest standard
              of care - directly and fairly - and to give patients and families control over the process
              of finding care that is reliable, consistent, and compassionate in the comfort of their
              home.

            <h3 class="text-center mb-4">The Idea</h3>
            <p>In home healthcare, finding reliable nurses and caregivers has always been a challenge.
              Families often struggle with limited options, lack of transparency, and heavy dependence on
              intermediaries.</p>
            <p>We envisioned a platform that stood for trust, accessibility, and fairness—where patients
              could connect directly with skilled homecare nurses, and caregivers could earn with dignity.
            </p>
            <p>That’s how Vitoxyz was born.</p>
